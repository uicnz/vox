    ///
    /// **Rationale:** This feels responsive for intentional double-taps while being
    /// long enough to avoid accidental triggers. Tested to align with standard
    /// UI double-click timing expectations.
    ///
    /// **Used in:**
    /// - `HotKeyProcessor`: Double-tap lock detection

    /// **Rationale:** macOS uses modifier keys for many shortcuts:
    /// - Option+click = duplicate in Finder
    /// - Cmd+click = open in new tab
    /// - etc.
    ///
    /// A 0.3s minimum prevents accidental transcription when users perform these
    /// system actions. This value is enforced regardless of user's `minimumKeyTime` setting
    /// (though user can set higher if desired).

    ///
    /// **Value:** 1.0 second
    ///
    /// **Rationale:** For key+modifier hotkeys (e.g., Cmd+A), if user presses a different
    /// key within 1 second, it's likely accidental (fat-finger, muscle memory for different shortcut).
    /// After 1 second, we assume the user wants to type while recording.

    /// **Rationale:** Prevents very quick accidental taps while still feeling responsive.
    /// User-configurable in Settings. Modifier-only hotkeys override this with
    /// `modifierOnlyMinimumDuration` if higher.
